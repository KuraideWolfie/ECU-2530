## Assignment 02
### Assignment Description
This assignment was a re-iteration of the first assignment; however, instead of using loops, recursion is utilized, such as to print the numbers of the hailstone sequence. It performs the same as assignment 1, printing the following statistics:
- The hailstone sequence, terminated when 1 is reached
- The length of the hailstone sequence
- The largest integer of the sequence
- The starting integer, and length, of the longest sequence beginning with an integer in the range of 1 and n (the user-chosen integer)
